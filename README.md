Gas money calculation script evaluates input parameters and calculates final gas price for a journey. 

The input parameters are:
- Origin (str):           city, village, town, lat-long (e.g. bratislava)
- Destination (str):      city, village, town, lat-long (e.g. Banská Štiavnica)
- Car Manufacturer (str): full name of car brand (e.g. audi, Alfa Romeo)
- Car model (str):        full designation of model (e.g. a7, giulia cabrio)
- Fuel type (str):        type of fuel used (e.g. diesel, Gasoline)

Script calculates distance between origin and destination, evaluates average fuel consumption for specified car model including fuel type and finds current fuel prices. In the end, script returns information and statistics about journey and your car with final price amount spent on fuel.

The idea for this project came up, when I was selling some stuff online and buyers wanted some discount in change of their car trip to my place. Since I like to have well-grounded things in negotiation this was very handy and fun thing to do :).
